    "Reddit allows users to scrape its data using an API. Using the API ensures the website's data is being accessed ethically; it adheres to rate limits and can only access areas that are authorized by the website's developers. The API's existence supports the use of Reddit data for this project. <br> \n",

    "Subreddit's have been created for posts of high-quality images. Two examples are the subreddits r/tankporn and r/carporn. These subreddits have moderators which remove posts that do not contain images. The specific subject matter and moderation of these subreddits makes them ideal sources for streams of images that can be used in machine learning projects.<br> \n",

    "\n",
    "First, a path is defined for where the images will be saved. Credentials for accessing the Reddit API are stored and imported from a separate python module to protect the token's owner. Then the code iterates through post URLs and downloads any that end in .jpg or .png. The notebook was created using a combination of code inspired by Jacob Lower (2022), and Regis Jesuit's MSDS600 curriculum. \n",
